GetMapping - is used to map incoming request form browser. OR (If incoming request type is get so we use getmapping)



PostMapping - if we pass unlimitated data then we use postmapping it transfer data from body.
    		We can transfer data from url upto 64 kb and we can only transfer text data from url.


{ } - This is placeholder.

@Pathvariable- it takes or hold single value
@RequestBody - it takes form or we say in the body format. eg. Admission form (all information receive in json format)


Questions

1) how to get parameterized data from url
=> by using Placeholder{} and @Pathvariable
	eg. @GetMapping("/product/{name}")
		void string getproduct(@PathVaribale String name)
		{
			return name;
		}

2) how to get json(object )data from request
=> by using @PostMapping and @RequestBody
